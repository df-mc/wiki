Welcome to the Dragonfly wiki.

This wiki is the main source of information for developers looking to start developing servers and libraries 
using Dragonfly.

## What is Dragonfly?
Dragonfly is a server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (Android, iOS, Windows 10 and more). Written in Go, it allows simplistic code, super-fast startup and great performance and scaling.

Dragonfly can and is being used on production, but it's certainly not the most battle-tested. Please feel free to open issues for any bugs or features that you'd like to see addressed.

## Questions or need help?
Feel free to join our Discord server to talk.
